	<h1>Welcome to our Genius Hour project</h1>
	This project is intended to help students calculate what score they would need to achieve on their finals to 
	maintain a certain rank. In order to do this, we need to collect rank and GPA data from juniors at Plano West.
	If you would like to participate, please fill out the following form. All data is collected anonymously. 
	Please only submit once per person.

	<form name="form" action="belazy" method="post">
		Rank:<input name="rank" /> Your rank as it appears on your mid-year transcript<br />
		Total GPA:<input name="gpaTotal" /> Your GPA as it appears on your mid-year transcript<br />
		Semester GPA:<input name="gpaSemester" /> Your GPA for the first semester of junior year (you can calculate that <a href="/gpacalculator.html">here</a>)<br />
		<input type="submit" />
	</form>
	
	One day, this page will look better. Probably not this day though.
